**Bitcoin-based High School Economics Pilot**

**Introduction**
Today’s students (and parents) know little about Bitcoin, except that they’ve heard that it’s a way to get rich quickly. They know very little about why Bitcoin matters or how it might shape the future. Our students are growing up in a society where digital payment networks are plentiful but transparency into how they are built and operate is limited. They experience the hype of crypto token launches claiming 1000x gains and NFTs with similarly lofty promises and appealing use cases. Where economic policies are challenging to digest, and concerns over bank failures, recessions, and runaway inflation can lead to a feeling of disempowerment and unnecessary anxiety. Being armed with an education in the history of and an insight into the future of economics and how humans engineer economic theory and systems is an incredible asset in developing a student’s personal financial model. Economic literacy is an advantage that can help to lift disadvantaged student populations into being more financially secure, confident in their decision making, and engaged in the creation of future technologies to empower historically unbanked groups with greater capacity to participate in modern banking. An engaging education in the inclusive finance of Bitcoin is an opportunity to equip your students with a set of unprecedented skills to be prepared for the future!

**Description**

In this pilot program, students are exposed to the fundamentals of macro and micro economics through functional demonstrations of the abstract concepts that drive commerce. By interleaving academic lecture with interactive elements the core concepts are cemented in the learning process, and reinforced as subsequent concepts build upon the foundation of earlier sessions. The STEM adjacent curriculum ties economics back into its origins in mathematics and the current and future engineering efforts necessary to create modern FinTech infrastructure.

**Prerequisites**

The target audience for this course is high school students who have mastered basic mathematics concepts but no advanced statistics or economics. The curriculum is presented in an easy-to-consume format at a Flesch-Kincaid reading level of 9.6 with plentiful teacher-led interactive classroom activities.

Students will require access to a computer for the digital components of the course. For the interactive circular economy in-class demonstrations, students will need a cell phone capable of installing Android or iOS apps.

The facility will require an available 220v 20A circuit for the on-premises mining demonstration hardware, wifi or wired data connectivity, and regular power outlet in the network closet for the Bitcoin Node to operate in. If sufficient power is not available, 110V based miners can be acquired outside the scope of this program, or the miner can be used solely as a classroom manipulative to demonstrate the engineering principles used by the hardware.

The instructor should familiarize themselves with using a Lightning Wallet and have access to a small source of funds for the experiment (roughly 10k Satoshis per student). If funds are provided by the donor, the instructor should be prepared with a wallet on a personal handheld device, and be able to both pay and receive invoices prior to the start of the course.

**Objectives**

Successful completion of the course should provide students with:

-   A solid background on the history and current state of financial systems: from barter, to representative currency, fiat currency, digital currencies and Bitcoin.
-   The ability to explain how the Bitcoin proof of work network is secured and is impervious to counterfeit currency, debasement, and hacking.
-   A functional understanding of fractional reserve banking, CBDCs, UBI, and inflation
-   The ability to create a Bitcoin wallet, a lightning wallet, understand the basics behind the use of each, and transact in in-class circular economic exercises using Bitcoin over the Lightning Network.

**Required Texts**

The course is currently entirely based on the MiPrimer "My First Bitcoin Diploma" curriculum:

<https://github.com/MiPrimerBitcoin/Bitcoin-Diploma-English-Version>

This is a free to use open curriculum originally created for the nation of El Salvador which has now grown to use across numerous countries. There are new changes being added to the curriculum, so making sure you're working from the latest revision is important prior to beginning a course.

The textbook is 10 chapters, and is designed around 1.5 hour lessons, roughly 2 per chapter, the course can be completed in 20 class periods although if in-class exercises and demonstrations are skipped and the class is reduced to lecture-only, it can be reduced to 10-12 classes, this yields an undesirably boring experience.

**Bitcoin-in-a-Box**
The concept is to provide schools, classrooms, homeschool co-ops, etc, with an educational starter kit for teaching Bitcoin. Here are the ideas I have been working on:
* A Bitcoin miner, preferably one that runs at a lower decible rating and/or is underclocked running BraiinsOS, reducing its noise & power consumption. For schools in geos where the majority of the school year is colder, this should be a 3+ kW miner, and positioned as a cost-savings educational tool, as it generates heat for the school. This offsets the school's existing heating bill, while additionally earning Bitcoin for use in the classroom. For locations where heating is not a need, then a lower power/lower cost miner is sufficient, like a demonstration S9, which when underclocked has the added advantage of being able to be run inside a classroom off a standard outlet for extended periods of time with no repurcussions.
* If a wired network drop is not available, a wifi to Ethernet bridge is needed, we tested a couple of approaches and this one worked well: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BZTSRXRG but any equivalent device is fine.
* A large part of the curriculum is based on conducting lightning transactions block analysis websites, these tools (mempool.space & bitfeed) can be self-hosted alongside the Lightning server on hardware such as a Start9 Node: https://store.start9.com/collections/servers/products/server-one
* There is a potential also to use public custodial wallets in which case, delivering the classroom box with pre-loaded lightning vouchers such as Azteco vouchers, with the equivalent of 10,000 sats per student for the instructor to distribute at the appropriate time for the course.
* Some of the classroom manipulatives include materials that could be included in the box, such as printed worksheets, dry macaronis, etc.
